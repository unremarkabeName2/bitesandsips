# bitesandsips
please mask up between bites and sips

clarification:
I am not against masking (quite the opposite) but the actions OSU has taken to combat covid are ridiculous and provably ineffective.
Masking between bites and sips is worthy of ridicule when compared to the fact that so many OSU classes are still in person, with full lecture halls and no possiblity of physical distancing.
In addition, OSU's programs regularly ignore the rules that the administration has set 
(see: https://twitter.com/OhioStateFB/status/1480620270545039360 | https://web.archive.org/web/20220110191940/https://twitter.com/OhioStateFB/status/1480620270545039360)

On top of its ineffective restrictions on covid, the masking rules are poorly enforced, and many students are not wearing masks indoors.
If a student is infected with covid, they cannot expect any support from the university either - there is no guarantee of quarantine housing.

This is not meant as some anti-mask or anti-vax thing, it's meant as a criticism of the university's poor decisions in regard to student and staff health and safety.
